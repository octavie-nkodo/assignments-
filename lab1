1) software engineering is not part of the systems engineering process.
The conduct of systems engineering planning does not require knowledge or training in the physical sciences.
Inputs from those using systems engineering is based on the traditional areas of engineering.
 
2) software crisis is a term used in the early days of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time.

3) analyse user requirements 
- write and test codes, refining and rewriting it as necessary and communicate with any programmers involved in the project.
- write operational documentation with technical authors 
- maintain systems by monitoring and correcting software defects
- develop existing programs by analyzing and identifying areas for modification 
- investigate new technologies 
- evaluate the software and systems that make computers and hardware work

4) true
Due to the previously tested components they produce more reliable system at a faster rate
